## Logging
Logging refers to the practice of recording events, messages, or data points generated by software applications and systems. These logs can include various types of information, such as:

    Error Messages: Details about errors and exceptions that occur.

    Access Logs: Records of who accessed what resources and when.

    Audit Logs: Records for compliance and security purposes

## Monitoring

Monitoring involves the continuous observation of a system to ensure it is operating correctly and efficiently. It includes tracking various metrics and performance indicators, such as:

    CPU Usage: Monitoring how much processing power is being used.

    Memory Usage: Tracking the amount of memory being utilized.

    Disk I/O: Observing read/write operations on storage devices.

    Space: Total amount of space available on the machine

    Network Traffic: Measuring data transfer rates and network activity.

    Application Performance: Monitoring response times, throughput, and error rates.

    A system goes down

    CPU usage goes above a certain point
