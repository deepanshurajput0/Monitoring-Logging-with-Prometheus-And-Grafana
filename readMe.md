    CPU Usage: Monitoring how much processing power is being used.

    Memory Usage: Tracking the amount of memory being utilized.

    Disk I/O: Observing read/write operations on storage devices.

    Space: Total amount of space available on the machine

    Network Traffic: Measuring data transfer rates and network activity.

    Application Performance: Monitoring response times, throughput, and error rates.
